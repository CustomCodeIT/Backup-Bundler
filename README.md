# Backup Bundler
---

## Disclaimer
This script is not even close to finished. But it will continue to be updated over time and eventually will be suitable for use by others.

## Introduction

Backup Bundler is a very simple Python script aimed at simplifying the process of archiving and encrypting large backups.

The typical use-case for this script would be getting backups ready for cloud storage.

## Is it Production Ready?

**No.** This script is still currently being developed and is not recommended for production (or really any) use. There are plenty of great tools out there that will do a safer and more reliable job. At least until it's finished.

## Why use it?

This script is not the fanciest or prettiest but does aim to be functional and simple to use.

## Supported Operating Systems

This script has only been tested on one Linux distribution. It most likely will not work on Windows or MacOS and will probably still fail to run on other Linux distributions.
